<p>Welcome to&nbsp;<a href="http://3.131.156.224/lush">18.191.207.84/lush</a>- The wonderful world
    of LUSH FRESH HANDMADE COSMETICS. This website is operated by Lush Fresh Handmade Cosmetics
    Kuwait. Just so you know, when you use and/or order products from this website, you are agreeing
    to these here terms and conditions, and, from this point on wards, any reference to "we", "us",
    "our" or "ourselves" refers to LUSH Kuwait. Which makes sense really, right?<br></p><p><br></p>
<p><br></p><p>We hope you have a lovely experience on our website. Please, if you do spot any
    errors, hop on your computer as soon as you can and e-mail us at customercare@lushkw.com so that
    we can work on getting it fixed as soon as we can.</p><p>Because all of our products are fresh,
    handmade and contain lots of fresh ingredients, each batch of our products can come out slightly
    differently. This can then mean the product will differ from the one that gets delivered to your
    front door, despite our best efforts to replicate the colors on the website. Colors also show up
    differently on different monitors.</p><p>We are not encouraged to deliver products that melt,
    drip or require refrigeration (eg: Body butters, Massage Bars and Face Masks).</p><p>To ensure
    that these products get to you in their perfect form and quality, we encourage them to be
    purchased from one of our Lush shops!</p><p><br></p><p>So, are you sitting comfortably? Good,
    then we shall begin!</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>1. Ordering</p><p>Before you can
    place an order, you will need to register and then log in. Everyone is allowed one customer
    account. You are more than welcome to send lots of Lush to your friends, but they may live in a
    different house. All you need to do is complete a separate order for each different delivery
    address. Easy!</p><p><br></p><p>Very occasionally, if the technology fails us or we make a
    genuine mistake, your order attempt may be unsuccessful. While we can't be held liable for this,
    we will do everything we can to resolve this for you and put that smile back on your face
    again.</p><p><br></p><p>Once your order has been accepted, you just pay the sum that you see at
    the end of the checkout process, together with the delivery fee. We will only accept credit or
    debit cards in the name of the customer placing the order. Customers without access to
    credit/debit cards, we accept cash on delivery (COD) as an alternative payment method for
    domestic shipments only. Once you have placed an order, you will receive a confirmation e-mail,
    and then another one within 24 hours of your order being dispatched, so you will know when to
    get the bath running! Please allow 1- 4 working days for processing and shipping your parcel.
    Orders placed between 12pm onwards from Thursday, Friday and Saturday will be processed on
    Saturday as Friday.</p><p>Placing an order is legally binding but this does not affect your
    statutory rights as a consumer. For more details you can also have a little look at
    'Cancellations and Returns' in these Terms and Conditions.</p><p>If, in our reasonable opinion,
    a customer acts against these Terms and Conditions, we do reserve the right to cancel or suspend
    their involvement in a sale. This includes non-payment of ordered products or fraudulent use of
    our website and/or sales. We also reserve the right to ban certain e-mail addresses and
    telephone numbers from accessing our website to place orders. We will not accept any order from
    any customer who we have cancelled or suspended.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>2.

    destinations outside Kuwait may be subject to taxes, fees, levies or other charges as a result
    of local legislation or customs formalities and we advise that you check the import charges
    applicable in your local country before ordering products to be delivered there.</p><p>The
    recipient of the order is responsible for all customs formalities for the import of the
    products, and will be required to pay any additional charges for international delivery,
    including import duty, formal customs entry, taxes, levies and other charges that may be levied
    outside Kuwait. The recipient of the products, not the person placing the order, will receive a
    separate request for payment of these charges. If you are ordering products to be delivered to
    someone else, please ensure they are made aware that they will be responsible for these
    additional charges.</p><p>You (or the recipient of the products if different) will be the
    importer for all international deliveries of the products. Therefore, before placing an order,
    it's your responsibility to check that any products ordered comply with state and federal
    government import regulations, and that there are no local requirements or restrictions which
    may affect receipt of your order.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>4. Prices</p><p>
